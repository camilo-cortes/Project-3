    <p>A controversial topic for many designers, the movement of aestheticism has long been seen as both a signification of the progress of man and one of man's worse creations. It focuses completely on "art for art's sake". This page contains some quotes from the founders of the movement.</p>
    <h3>John Newton</h3>

    <p>“I endeavored to renounce society, that I might avoid temptation. But it was a poor religion; so far as it prevailed, only tended to make me gloomy, stupid, unsociable, and useless.”</p>
    <h3>Kazimir Severinovich Malevich</h3>
    <p>“Aestheticism is the garbage of intuitive feeling.” </p>
    <h3>Vladimir Nabokov</h3>
    <p>"For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm. There are not many such books. All the rest is either topical trash or what some call the Literature of Ideas, which very often is topical trash coming in huge blocks of plaster that are carefully transmitted from age to age until somebody comes along with a hammer and takes a good crack at Balzac, at Gorki, at Mann.” </p>

    <p>"How can the author describe the madness and debauchery, the pleasures of revelry and drunkenness, the numberless games of life and death that were played day and night on that magnificent stage? You readers might find something that resembled it, in part, in your most fantastic, bloodiest, and most beautiful nightmares.” </p>
    <h3>Patrick Bryant</h3>
    <p>“Pleading with those eyes, it's obvious what I'm meant to do. I embrace the beauty and kiss it deeply.” </p>
